# Account Management Application Website

Owner: Nguyen Ngoc Anh Thu

Briefly introduction:
 - My site is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, ReactJS and AntDesign,...

 - This website consists of six pages including welcome page, login page, dashboard page, total users page, my account page, and not found page. When a user attempts to access our website without logging in, they will only be able to view the welcome page, login page and not found page. 
 
 Upon providing valid login credentials, they will be redirected to the dashboard page, which provides an overview of the systems infomation. The total users page displays the total number of registered users on the website, while the my account page allows users to edit their account information.

 I have implemented two types of users: admin and normal. Admins have full access to the website's features and can view basic information of all users, add new users to the system and delete users, including themselves. In addition, admins can update their own information.
 Normal users have limited access to the website's features. They can only update their own information and view basic information for other users.

- This website is also flexible for many devices such as desktop, tablet and mobile

## PAGES

When you click on the "Get Started" button, you will be taken to a processing page. This may take a few moments, so please be patient.

### `Dashboard Page`

This page consists of some basic infomation:
* Total users in the system
* List of three users added/ updated today
* A chart of top 10 activity users in system (according to the login times)  
* Weather forecast information for the current day as well as the next two days. You can easily search for a location using the search bar provided.

### `Total Users Page`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
